First of all, we have a kind of interface.

We write the correct conjugation down to the input.

And then we check it. If it's correct, the firework effect is going to exist.

Else, it's going to throw a modal to describe you what's wrong.

## TODO

- Tailwindcss has a problem about its classes when they passed into a string via variables as mentioned in ![this SO topic](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70477538/tailwind-not-working-when-using-variables-react-js). The buttons don't look as they should so this must be solved.
